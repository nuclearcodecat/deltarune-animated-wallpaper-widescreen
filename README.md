wallpapers are by default available in webp, apng and gif formats.
apng is kind of fucked because the delay was incorrect and frames were too long, so i had to set it to match the closest to the original gif file.
i use the webp file with swww and it works perfectly.

if your screen resolution isn't here: clone the repo, edit generate_walls.sh, add your res to the array; then execute (`./generate_walls.sh`)

i grabbed the original image from deltarune.com
